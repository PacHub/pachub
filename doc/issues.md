Also, there is no one who loves pain itself, seeks or desires, only because it is pain, unless it comes to accidental circumstances, in which toil and pain can cause him great joy.

### There are you on the woodway

Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia live the blind texts. Secluded they live in Bookmarksgrove on the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Not even the all-powerful Pointing the blind texts are dominated - an almost unorthographic life. One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The big Oxmox advised her about it, since there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text did not listen.
She packed her seven capitals, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Wistful ran him a rhetorical question on the cheek, then she continued her way. On the way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text, where they would herk√§me been rewritten a thousand times and everything still left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country. But it did not convince Gutzureden everything and so it was not long until he lay in wait for a few insidious Copy Writers, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her again and again for their projects.
And if she has not been rewritten, then they are still using her. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia live the blind texts.

### I see black for you

A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and me of my existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single line, and I never was a greater artist than in those moments.
If the love valley evaporated around me, and the high sun rests on the surface of the impenetrable darkness of my forest, and only a few rays steal into the inner sanctuary, I then lay in the high grass on the falling stream, and closer to the earth a thousand varied blades of grass are strange to me; when I feel the buzz of the little world between blades, the innumerable, inscrutable figures of worms, the M√ºckchen closer to my heart, and feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which us in eternal bliss Mid transmits and receives; my friend! If it then dawns around my eyes, and the world around me and the whole sky in my soul Ruhn like the form of a lover - then I crave often and think, oh, I could do to express again, you could breathe the papers what so full, so warm lives in you that it would mirror of your soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God!

### I fall from all clouds

There are at the moment in this team, oh, forget some of them professional players what they are. I do not read a lot of newspapers, but I have heard many situations. First, we have not played offensively. There is no German team plays offensively and the name offensive as Bavaria. Last game we had in place three peaks: Elber, Jancka and then Zickler. We must not forget Zickler. Zickler is a more peaks, Mehmet eh more Basler. Clearly these words is possible to understand what I said? Thank you. Offensively, the offensive is how we do in space. Second: I have explained this with two players: to Dortmund halftime might need a break. I have also seen other teams in Europe after this Wednesday. I have also seen two days training.
A coach is not an idiot! A coach should see what will happen in court. In this game there are two, three of these players were were weak like a bottle empty! Have you seen Wednesday, which team has played Wednesday? Has played Mehmet or played Basler or Trapattoni has played? These players complain more than they play! Do you know why the Italian teams do not buy these players? Because we have seen many times such a game! Did you say are not players for the Italian master! Strunz! Strunz is here for two years, has played 10 games, is always hurt! What empowers Strunz? Last years champion Become Hamann, eh, Nerlinger. These players were players! Goods become champions! Is always hurt! Has played 25 games in this team in this club.
Must respect the other fellow! have a lot of nice colleagues! Ask colleagues the question! Have no courage to words, but I know what to think about these players. Mussen show now, I want Saturday, these players have to show me his fans, must alone win the game. Must alone win the game! I'm tired now father these players, eh defender this player. I have always blame this player. One is Mario, one other is Mehmet! Strunz I do not speak, has played only 25 percent of the game. I have finished! . . . if there were questions, I can repeat words. . . There are at the moment in this team, oh, forget some of them professional players what they are. I do not read a lot of newspapers, but I have heard many situations. First, we have not played offensively. There is no German team plays offensively and the name offensive as Bavaria.

### Not the yellow of the egg

He heard soft footsteps behind him. That did not bode well. Who would follow him, late at night and do in this narrow alley in the middle of a bad reputation Waterfront? Especially now, when he had turned the thing in his life and wanted to disappear with the loot! Had one of his numerous colleagues had the same idea, watched him and waited to now to ease him to the fruits of his labor? Or were the steps behind him to one of the many law enforcement officers of this city, and the steely night at his wrists would snap the same? He could hear the call to stop already. Rushed he looked around. Suddenly he caught sight of the narrow passage. In a flash, he turned to the right and disappeared between the two buildings.
He almost dropped it on the overturned trash can, was lying in the road. He tried to feel his way in the dark and froze: Apparently there was no other way out of this small yard than the passage by which he had come. The steps grew louder and louder, he saw a dark figure turn around the corner. Feverishly his eyes wandered through the darkness of the night and were looking for a way out. Was now really all over, were all trouble and all the preparations for free? He pressed close in on the wall behind him and hoped the prosecutor would see him, when suddenly with a hardly noticeable squeak swung a door in the night wind back and forth beside him. Could this the pleading awaited way out of his dilemma be?
Slowly he moved toward the open door, always pressed tightly against the wall. Would that door be his salvation? He heard soft footsteps behind him. That did not bode well. Who would follow him, late at night and do in this narrow alley in the middle of a bad reputation Waterfront?
